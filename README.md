About
=====

Writer Mortis is an experiment in Ruby on Rails and storytelling.

It's a web app for writing collaborative stories like an exquisite corpse -- users contribute to a story by only seeing the chunk contributed by the previous user.

Installation
============
Install RVM to manage ruby versions and your Gemset for this project.

`git clone` the repo

`cp config/application.yml.exampl config/application.yml` and fill out variables

Run `rake db:migrate` to set up the schema

Run `rake db:seed` to initialize examples and default values (This part is IMPORTANT!)
